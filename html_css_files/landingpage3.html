                 <h3>Introduction</h3>
                 <p>Hello! My name is Lucas Szikszai and I was born in 1990 in Germany.
                     I originally studied biology, but ended up taking a break to help my father out in his art gallery.
                     I have always been someone who is constantly learning new things and seeking out new experiences.
                     Currently, I am focusing on broadening my skills as a full stack developer.
                     In my free time, I enjoy going on hikes and I even had the opportunity to walk the Camino de Santiago, which was a truly memorable experience for me.
                     Overall, I am always looking for ways to challenge myself and grow both personally and professionally.
